# Flo's Whistle: Pandemic

Flo's Whistle is a whistle blowing application for Nurses. It will allow them to easily report when staffing levels are low and pose a danger to patients.

There is no systematic way for front line workers to report shortages of resources, and whistle blowers risk losing their jobs. Flo's Whistle: Pandemic allows anonymous reporting from app on phone for first responders, hospital workers (nurses physicians respiratory therapists), and nursing home staff. The dashboard will show untraceable location by displaying location in congressional district.

## Develop
### Application
The application is a React application that utilizes Sass for styling. To work on
this application, cd into the app directory and run npm install and npm start.

The page level components are stored in src/views. Shared components are stored
in src/shared. Some default styling is stored in the files in src/defaults, but
most page/component specific styles are stored with their JavaScript definitions.
