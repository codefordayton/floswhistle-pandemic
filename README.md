# Flo's Whistle

Flo's Whistle is a whistle blowing application for Nurses. It will allow them to easily report
when staffing levels are low and pose a danger to patients.

Project Lead: Janet Michaelis

Please join the #floswhistle channel on the http://opendayton.org slack workspace to chat

## Develop
### Application
The application is a React application that utilizes Sass for styling. To work on
this application, cd into the app directory and run npm install and npm start.

The page level components are stored in src/views. Shared components are stored
in src/shared. Some default styling is stored in the files in src/defaults, but
most page/component specific styles are stored with their JavaScript definitions.
